## Fixed Chests

So it turns out that category chests only populate their Drop Table with items that ONLY have the same tag
For example Healing Chests can only drop: Slugs, Medkits, Scythe, Seed, Antlers (this also gives antler a 0.0045% drop chance from healing chests)(Bungus has healing AND no AI tag so it doesnt get included)
This fixes that.

Note: This is a bug is only present in SotV->v1.2.2.0. It is due to be fixed next patch according the to devs
